# Clio
Clio is a Calliope client that runs as a JavaScript app in a Web browser. Today, Clio
can be found online at [https://calliope.chrisimmel.com/clio/](https://calliope.chrisimmel.com/clio/)

In Greek mythology, Clio (traditionally /ˈklaɪoʊ/, but now more frequently
/ˈkliːoʊ/; Greek: Κλειώ), is the muse of history, or in a few mythological accounts,
the muse of lyre playing.

Clio is mostly used for testing Calliope, although it may someday be used as a way
to deploy certain Calliope applications in non-Sparrow settings.
