# Clio
Clio is a Calliope client that runs as a TypeScript app in a Web browser. Today, Clio
can be found online at [https://calliope.chrisimmel.com/clio/](https://calliope.chrisimmel.com/clio/).

In Greek mythology, Clio (traditionally /ˈklaɪoʊ/, but now more frequently
/ˈkliːoʊ/; Greek: Κλειώ), is the muse of history, or in a few mythological accounts,
the muse of lyre playing.

Clio is mostly used for testing Calliope, although it may someday be used as a way
to deploy certain Calliope applications in non-Sparrow settings.

In Clio, you can:
* Browse, create, and extend stories.
* Send a photo or spoken text fragment to influence a story in progress.
* Review all the pages/frames of a story.

## Experimental Features

Certain experimental features can be activated in Clio by adding the `?x=1` parameter to the URL. Currently, this makes available a longer list of storytelling strategies, as well as the video generation feature.
