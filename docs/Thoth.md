# Thoth
Thoth is a "back-office" UI meant to enable the artists and engineers creating the art works
to inspect and monitor all stories that are being created. Stories can be browsed and searched. It's meant only for internal use, so there is little to no effort at UX considerations.

A running version can for now be found [here](https://calliope-ugaidvq5sa-uc.a.run.app/thoth). Like Clio, it is unsecured, so I'm standing ready to take it down if it suffers abuse or too much traffic.

In Egyptian mythology, Thoth is the messenger and recorder of the deities, the master of knowledge. The curious may read more at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoth).
