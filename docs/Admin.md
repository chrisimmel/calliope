# Calliope Admin
Calliope Admin is an administrative UI that manages the configuration of a deployed Calliope system. It enables an authorized user to view, create, or edit any of the managed objects in the Calliope database. This is how an admin manages things like inference models, prompt templates, and individual clients or flocks of clients.

## Implementation

Calliope Admin is mostly automatically constructed from the Piccolo model definitions through use of the [Piccolo Admin](https://piccolo-orm.com/ecosystem/) framework.
